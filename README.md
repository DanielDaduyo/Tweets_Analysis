# Tweets Analysis

The repository currently includes two projects:

### 01 - Tweets counter

### 02 - Who is the most tweeted?
Within every TV show, there are always people and characters who are highly commented on Twitter. The aim of the project is to create a ranking of the cast of the chosen show based on the amount of tweets about them within the official hashtag.

Here an example:
